# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a comprehensive Python framework inspired by Java Spring Framework. The framework will provide infrastructure support for building robust, scalable, and testable enterprise applications with features including dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, declarative transaction management, and enterprise integration capabilities. The framework aims to promote loose coupling, high cohesion, and clean separation of concerns in Python applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Inversion of Control (IoC) Container

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want a central container to manage object lifecycles and dependencies, so that I can build loosely coupled applications without manual dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework initializes THEN the system SHALL create a central IoC container that manages object instances
2. WHEN a class is registered with the container THEN the system SHALL store its metadata and instantiation rules
3. WHEN an object is requested from the container THEN the system SHALL resolve all its dependencies automatically
4. WHEN circular dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL raise a clear error with dependency chain information
5. IF an object is configured as singleton THEN the system SHALL return the same instance for all requests
6. IF an object is configured as prototype THEN the system SHALL create a new instance for each request

### Requirement 2: Dependency Injection (DI)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multiple ways to inject dependencies into my classes, so that I can choose the most appropriate injection method for each use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a class uses constructor injection THEN the system SHALL automatically inject dependencies through the constructor
2. WHEN a class uses setter injection THEN the system SHALL inject dependencies through setter methods
3. WHEN a class uses field injection with annotations THEN the system SHALL inject dependencies directly into annotated fields
4. WHEN dependencies are injected THEN the system SHALL validate that all required dependencies are available
5. IF a dependency cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL raise a descriptive error indicating the missing dependency
6. WHEN optional dependencies are specified THEN the system SHALL inject them if available or skip if not found

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the framework using Python decorators and configuration files, so that I can define beans and their relationships declaratively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classes are decorated with @Component THEN the system SHALL automatically register them in the IoC container
2. WHEN classes are decorated with @Service THEN the system SHALL register them as service layer components
3. WHEN classes are decorated with @Repository THEN the system SHALL register them as data access components
4. WHEN methods are decorated with @Bean THEN the system SHALL use them as factory methods for object creation
5. WHEN configuration classes are defined THEN the system SHALL process them to configure the container
6. WHEN external configuration files are provided THEN the system SHALL load and apply the configuration settings

### Requirement 4: Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to modularize cross-cutting concerns like logging and security, so that I can keep my business logic clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN aspects are defined with pointcuts THEN the system SHALL identify matching join points in the application
2. WHEN advice is configured for a pointcut THEN the system SHALL execute the advice at the appropriate time
3. WHEN @Before advice is defined THEN the system SHALL execute it before the target method
4. WHEN @After advice is defined THEN the system SHALL execute it after the target method completes
5. WHEN @Around advice is defined THEN the system SHALL allow the advice to control method execution
6. WHEN exceptions occur in advised methods THEN @AfterThrowing advice SHALL be executed
7. IF multiple aspects apply to the same join point THEN the system SHALL execute them in defined precedence order

### Requirement 5: Transaction Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want declarative transaction management, so that I can handle database transactions without writing boilerplate transaction code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN methods are decorated with @Transactional THEN the system SHALL automatically manage transactions
2. WHEN a transactional method starts THEN the system SHALL begin a new transaction or join an existing one
3. WHEN a transactional method completes successfully THEN the system SHALL commit the transaction
4. WHEN an exception occurs in a transactional method THEN the system SHALL rollback the transaction
5. WHEN transaction propagation is specified THEN the system SHALL honor the propagation behavior
6. WHEN transaction isolation levels are specified THEN the system SHALL apply the appropriate isolation
7. IF nested transactions are used THEN the system SHALL handle them according to propagation rules

### Requirement 6: Data Access Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent data access layer abstraction, so that I can work with different databases using a unified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository interfaces are defined THEN the system SHALL provide automatic implementations
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle connection management automatically
3. WHEN SQL queries are executed THEN the system SHALL provide proper exception translation
4. WHEN ORM integration is used THEN the system SHALL support popular Python ORMs like SQLAlchemy
5. WHEN database transactions fail THEN the system SHALL translate database-specific exceptions to framework exceptions
6. WHEN connection pooling is configured THEN the system SHALL manage database connections efficiently

### Requirement 7: Enterprise Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate with other enterprise technologies and frameworks, so that I can build comprehensive enterprise applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web frameworks are integrated THEN the system SHALL provide seamless integration with Flask, FastAPI, or Django
2. WHEN message queues are used THEN the system SHALL support integration with RabbitMQ, Redis, or Apache Kafka
3. WHEN caching is required THEN the system SHALL provide caching abstractions and implementations
4. WHEN scheduling is needed THEN the system SHALL support cron-like job scheduling
5. WHEN REST APIs are built THEN the system SHALL provide tools for API development and documentation
6. WHEN microservices are developed THEN the system SHALL support service discovery and communication patterns

### Requirement 8: Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support, so that I can easily write unit and integration tests for my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the system SHALL provide test-specific IoC container configurations
2. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN the system SHALL support easy dependency replacement in tests
3. WHEN integration testing THEN the system SHALL provide test database and transaction management
4. WHEN testing web endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide test client utilities
5. WHEN testing aspects THEN the system SHALL allow verification of advice execution
6. WHEN test profiles are used THEN the system SHALL load appropriate test configurations

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to be performant and scalable, so that my applications can handle enterprise-level loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container initializes THEN the system SHALL complete startup in reasonable time even with many beans
2. WHEN objects are resolved THEN the system SHALL cache resolution paths for performance
3. WHEN aspects are applied THEN the system SHALL minimize runtime overhead
4. WHEN concurrent requests are processed THEN the system SHALL handle thread safety appropriately
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL not cause memory leaks in long-running applications
6. WHEN profiling is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and diagnostics

### Requirement 10: Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent tooling and documentation, so that I can be productive and learn the framework easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and diagnostic information
3. WHEN learning the framework THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be available
4. WHEN IDE support is used THEN the system SHALL provide type hints and auto-completion
5. WHEN configuration issues arise THEN the system SHALL validate configurations and report problems clearly
6. WHEN migrating from other frameworks THEN migration guides SHALL be available
