# Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive Python framework inspired by Java Spring Framework. The framework, tentatively named "Summer Core", will provide enterprise-grade infrastructure for building scalable, maintainable Python applications with features including dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, declarative transaction management, and enterprise integration capabilities.

The framework follows the same core principles as Spring Framework:
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** - Central container manages object lifecycles and dependencies
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** - Modularizes cross-cutting concerns
- **Convention over Configuration** - Sensible defaults with declarative configuration
- **Non-invasive Design** - POPOs (Plain Old Python Objects) without framework coupling
- **Testability** - Built-in support for testing and mocking

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The framework consists of several interconnected layers:

1. **Application Layer** - User code (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
2. **Summer Core Framework** - IoC Container, AOP Engine, Transaction Manager, Configuration System
3. **Integration Layer** - Web, Database, Message Queue, Caching integrations
4. **Infrastructure** - Proxy Factory, Reflection Utils, Metadata Scanner, Lifecycle Management

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. IoC Container and Dependency Injection System

The IoC container is the heart of the framework, providing comprehensive dependency injection and inversion of control capabilities.

**ApplicationContext Interface:**
- Central interface for accessing the Spring IoC container
- Provides methods for retrieving beans by name and type
- Manages bean scopes (singleton, prototype, request, session, custom)
- Handles bean lifecycle callbacks (initialization, destruction)
- Publishes application events and manages event listeners
- Loads and manages configuration resources (classpath, filesystem)
- Provides environment abstraction with profiles and properties

**BeanDefinition Class:**
- Holds complete metadata about beans including scope, dependencies, and lifecycle methods
- Supports factory methods, constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection
- Configurable lazy initialization and primary bean designation
- Bean lifecycle callbacks: @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy
- Conditional bean registration based on profiles and properties

**BeanFactory:**
- Core container that instantiates and manages beans with full lifecycle support
- Resolves dependencies using constructor, setter, and field injection
- Detects and prevents circular dependencies with detailed error reporting
- Manages bean scopes with proper cleanup and resource management
- Integrates with AOP for proxy creation and aspect weaving

**Bean Lifecycle Management:**
- **Instantiation Phase:** Object creation via constructors or factory methods
- **Population Phase:** Dependency injection and property setting
- **Initialization Phase:** @PostConstruct callbacks and InitializingBean interface
- **Ready Phase:** Bean is fully configured and ready for use
- **Destruction Phase:** @PreDestroy callbacks and DisposableBean interface

**Bean Scopes:**
- **Singleton:** Single instance per container (default)
- **Prototype:** New instance for each request
- **Request:** Single instance per HTTP request (web applications)
- **Session:** Single instance per HTTP session (web applications)
- **Custom Scopes:** Extensible scope mechanism for specialized use cases

### 2. Dependency Injection System

**Decorator-based Configuration:**
- `@component`, `@service`, `@repository` for automatic bean registration
- `@configuration` and `@bean` for Java-style configuration classes
- `@autowired` for dependency injection with type-based resolution

**Injection Types:**
- Constructor injection (recommended for required dependencies)
- Setter injection (for optional dependencies)
- Field injection (for convenience, though less testable)

**Qualifier Support:**
- `@qualifier` for disambiguating beans of the same type
- Primary bean designation for default selection
- Collection injection for all beans of a type

### 3. Aspect-Oriented Programming System

**Aspect Framework:**
- `@aspect` decorator for defining aspects
- `@pointcut` for reusable pointcut expressions
- Advice types: `@before`, `@after`, `@after_returning`, `@after_throwing`, `@around`

**Proxy Creation:**
- Dynamic proxy generation using Python's dynamic features
- Support for both interface-based and class-based proxies
- Method interception with join point information

**Pointcut Expressions:**
- AspectJ-style expressions adapted for Python
- Support for method execution, class matching, and annotation-based pointcuts
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) for complex expressions

### 4. Transaction Management System

**Declarative Transactions:**
- `@transactional` decorator for method-level transaction management
- Configurable propagation behavior (REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW, etc.)
- Isolation levels and timeout support
- Rollback rules based on exception types

**Transaction Manager Interface:**
- Abstraction over different transaction technologies
- Support for database transactions, JTA, and custom implementations
- Integration with popular Python ORMs (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)

### 5. Event Listening Mechanism

**Application Event System:**
- Publisher-subscriber pattern for loose coupling between components
- `@EventListener` decorator for method-based event handling
- `ApplicationEventPublisher` interface for publishing events
- Built-in events: ContextRefreshedEvent, ContextClosedEvent, BeanCreatedEvent
- Custom event types extending `ApplicationEvent` base class
- Asynchronous event processing with `@Async` support
- Event ordering and conditional event handling

### 6. Resource Loading System

**Resource Abstraction:**
- Unified interface for loading resources from various sources
- `Resource` interface with implementations for classpath, filesystem, URL resources
- `ResourceLoader` for location-independent resource access
- Pattern-based resource matching (wildcards, ant-style patterns)
- Resource caching and validation mechanisms

**Configuration Loading:**
- Properties file loading with environment-specific overrides
- YAML configuration support with nested property structures
- Environment variable integration and property placeholder resolution
- Profile-specific configuration loading (@Profile annotation)

### 7. Type Conversion System

**Conversion Service:**
- Extensible type conversion framework
- Built-in converters for common types (string, numbers, dates, collections)
- Custom converter registration via `@Converter` annotation
- Generic converter interface for type-safe conversions
- Property editor integration for legacy compatibility
- Collection and array conversion support

**Property Binding:**
- Automatic conversion during dependency injection
- Configuration property binding to POPOs
- Validation integration with conversion process
- Error handling for conversion failures

### 8. Data Access Abstraction

**Repository Pattern:**
- Generic repository interfaces with common CRUD operations
- Automatic implementation generation for simple repositories
- Custom query method support with naming conventions
- Integration with ORM frameworks (SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM)

**Exception Translation:**
- Database-specific exceptions translated to framework exceptions
- Consistent error handling across different data access technologies
- Connection pool management and resource cleanup

## Data Models

### Bean Registry
Central registry maintaining:
- Bean definitions and their metadata
- Singleton instances cache
- Type-to-bean name mappings
- Dependency graph for circular dependency detection

### Configuration Metadata
Stores information about:
- Configuration classes and their bean factory methods
- Component scan packages
- Property sources and profiles
- Conditional bean registration rules

## Error Handling

### Framework Exceptions
- `SummerFrameworkException` - Base exception class
- `BeanCreationException` - Bean instantiation failures
- `CircularDependencyException` - Dependency cycle detection
- `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` - Missing bean errors
- `TransactionException` - Transaction-related errors

### Error Recovery
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Detailed error messages with resolution suggestions
- Debug information for troubleshooting
- Integration with Python logging framework

## Testing Strategy

### Test Framework Integration
- `TestApplicationContext` for test-specific configuration
- Mock bean registration and replacement
- Integration test base classes
- Automatic test dependency injection

### Testing Utilities
- `@test_configuration` for test-specific beans
- `@mock_bean` for replacing beans with mocks
- Transaction rollback for test isolation
- Test profile activation

### Performance Testing
- Bean creation and dependency resolution benchmarks
- AOP proxy overhead measurement
- Memory usage monitoring
- Concurrent access testing

This design provides a solid foundation for implementing a comprehensive Python framework that brings the power and flexibility of Spring Framework to the Python ecosystem, while respecting Python's idioms and best practices.
